# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to create a map that displays earthquake data all across the world. We added layers to the map to show specific data regarding earthquakes such as: tectonic plate boundaries, earthquake markers sized by their magnitude, and we also color-coded the earthquakes. We gathered our GeoJSON data from USGS data.
